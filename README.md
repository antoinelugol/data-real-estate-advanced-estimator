## A real statistical estimator

We now have access to a database of 1000 flats! We can't solve the system of linear equation like we did in the previous challenge because our matrix is not square this time!

You will learn how to **approximate** solutions of a linear algebra problem that has no deterministic solution, in order to implement your first statistical estimator of real estate prices by hand!

Launch `jupyter notebook` in your terminal then open the `real_estate_advanced_estimator.ipynb` notebook.
